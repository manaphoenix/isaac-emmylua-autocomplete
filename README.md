# Isaac EmmyLua Autocomplete
Isaac EmmyLua Autocomplete adds in autocomplete and typing features using [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua) for [The Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/) modding API.

This relies on [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua) to work.

# Credits
[IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/); specifically, it makes use of its [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions.
See more [here](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaac-typescript-definitions).

[EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua); without this the project would not work at all, thank you to them!
